# Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of
# non-alphabetic characters, write a function that returns that string
# with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one
# or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only
# have one space in the result (i.e., the result string should never
# have consecutive spaces).
