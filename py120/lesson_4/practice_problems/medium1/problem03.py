# Let's practice creating an object hierarchy.

# Create a class called Animal with a single instance method called speak that
# takes a string argument and prints that argument to the terminal.

# Now create two other classes that inherit from Animal, one called Cat and
# one called Dog. The Cat class should have a meow instance method that takes
# no arguments and prints Meow!. The Dog class should have a bark instance
# method that says Woof! Woof! Woof! (dogs never bark just once). Make use of
# the Animal class's speak method when implementing the Cat and Dog classes.
# Don't invoke the print function in either of the subclasses.

class Animal:
    def speak(self, message):
        print(message)

class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        self.speak('Meow!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        self.speak('Woof! Woof! Woof!')


cosmo = Cat()
cosmo.meow()

lucky = Dog()
