# What are the benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python? Think
# of as many as you can.

# - Modularity and Organization. OOP breaks complex problems into smaller,
# manageable pieces. It makes large codebases easier to understand and
# navigate
# - Encapsulation. With OOP, you can hide implementation details behind well-
# definied public interfaces. You can change how a class works without
# changing the code that uses it, so long as the public interface remains the
# same.
# - Code Reusability. Through inheritance and composition you can build new
# functionality on top of existing code
# - Intuitive modeling. OOP maps well to how we naturally think about the
# world. Objects feel natural and make code easier to reason about
# - Polymorphism. You can write code that works with objects of different
# types as long as they share a common interface. This leads to more flexible
# and extensible designs

# - As software becomes more complex, OOP helps manage this complexity.
# - It lets programmers create containers for data that can be changed and
# manipulated without affecting the entire program.
# - It lets programmers section off areas of code that perform specific
# procedures. This allows their programs to become the interaction of many
# small parts as opposed to a massive blob of dependencies.
# - We can talk about objects as nouns and their behaviors as verbs. These
# distincitions make it easier to conceptualize the structure of an OO
# program.
# - Creating classes and objects lets programmers think about code at a more
# abstract level.
# - It lets programmers write code that can be used with different kinds of
# data.
# - We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
