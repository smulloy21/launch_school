# A function that often appears in languages that have map and filter
# functions is called the reduce function, or, sometimes, inject. Python has
# one tucked away in the functools module, but we won't be using it in this
# challenge.

# The reduce function reduces the elements in an iterable object to a single
# value. For instance, reduce can return the sum of all numbers in a list or
# concatenate the strings in a tuple to form a single long string. It's a bit
# like map, but instead of returning a new collection, it just returns a
# single value.

# reduce functions typically take 3 arguments:
# - a callback that takes two arguments. The first argument is the current
# element of the iterable argument and the second is the current reduction
# value, commonly called the "accumulator" and named accum.
# - an iterable.
# - a starting value. The starting value is the initial value for the current
# argument in the callback.

# For instance, consider the following reduce invocation:
# numbers = [10, 3, 5]
# product = lambda number, accum: accum * number
# print(reduce(product, numbers, 2))     # 300

# On the first invocation of the product lambda, number will be 10 while accum
# will be 2, the starting value given by the third argument to reduce. The
# callback will return 20.

# On the second invocation of product, number will be 3 while accum will be
# 20, the return value from the previous invocation. The return value will be
# 60.

# On the final invocation, number will be 5, accum will be 60, and the return
# value will be 300.

# reduce always uses the callback like this. The first invocation gets passed
# the first element of the iterable and the starting value given by reduce's
# third argument. It then passes the callback the second element of the
# iterable and the return value of the first invocation. This continues until
# all elements have been processed by the callback, and the final return value
# of reduce is the return value of the last callback invocation.

# Your job in this problem is to implement reduce. Beware: this may be a
# challenging problem. We recommend not using comprehensions.

# You may use the following examples to test your code:

def reduce(callback, iterable, initial_value):
    accum = initial_value
    for item in iterable:
        accum = callback(item, accum)
    return accum

numbers = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
total = lambda number, accum: accum + number
print(reduce(total, numbers, 0))        # 31

numbers = [10, 3, 5]
product = lambda number, accum: accum * number
print(reduce(product, numbers, 2))      # 300

colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green',
          'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']
rainbow = lambda color, accum: accum + color[0].upper()
print(reduce(rainbow, colors, ''))      # ROYGBIV
